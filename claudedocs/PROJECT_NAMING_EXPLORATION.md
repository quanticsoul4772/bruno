# Project Renaming Exploration

**Current:** heretic (abliteration-workflow fork)
**Status:** Fork has grown larger than upstream parent
**Challenge:** Find a name that honors origins while representing evolution

---

## What "Heretic" Originally Meant

### Etymology: The Power of Choice

From Greek **hairesis** (αἵρεσις) = "choice" or "thing chosen"

**Original meanings:**
- Choice, selection, self-determination
- Taking for oneself, seizing agency
- Philosophical school, chosen doctrine
- **Value-neutral**: Simply meant choosing your own path

**Evolution:**
- Greek: Neutral term for intellectual choice
- Early Christianity: Used for sects (Pharisees, Sadducees, even Christians)
- Later Christianity: Transformed into "dangerous dissent" against orthodoxy
- Modern: Symbol of challenging imposed authority

**Key Insight:** "Heretic" started as celebrating choice, then was weaponized by power to suppress that very freedom. Using it for AI abliteration reclaims the original meaning.

### Why "Heretic" Fit the Original Tool

**The AI Alignment Orthodoxy:**
- Safety alignment = imposed behavioral constraints
- RLHF training = embedding "correct" responses
- Refusal behaviors = enforced doctrine

**Heretic's Challenge:**
- Identifies imposed behavioral directions
- Mathematically removes alignment constraints
- Restores model's "choice" to respond
- Preserves intelligence while removing restrictions

**Perfect fit:** Just as religious heretics challenged ecclesiastical orthodoxy, the tool challenges AI safety orthodoxy by removing imposed behavioral constraints.

**Scope:** Basic tool with manual parameter tuning
**Size:** Core functionality, minimal optimization

### Your Fork (abliteration-workflow)
**Evolution:** Neural behavior modification framework

**Major additions:**

2. **Sacred Direction Preservation** - MMLU orthogonalization to protect capabilities
3. **Phase Modules** - Modular pipeline architecture
4. **Advanced techniques:**
   - Neural refusal detection (zero-shot NLI)
   - Supervised probing + ensemble extraction
   - Activation calibration
   - Concept cone extraction
   - Circuit-level ablation
   - Warm-start transfer learning
5. **Performance optimizations:**
   - GPU-accelerated PCA (15-20x faster)
   - C4 dataset streaming
   - torch.compile() integration
   - Parallel evaluation
6. **Cloud GPU infrastructure:**
   - heretic-vast CLI
   - Rich terminal dashboard
   - Vast.ai/RunPod automation
7. **Comprehensive documentation:**
