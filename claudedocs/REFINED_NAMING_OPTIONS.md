### 5. Prohairesis Orthogon
**Meaning:** "Moral Choice Through Orthogonalization"

**Why it works:**
- **Prohairesis** = Stoic concept of "moral choice" (προαίρεσις)
- More specific than hairesis (deliberate choice aligned with virtue)
- Used by Epictetus for "reasoned choice"
- Less common than hairesis (more unique)

**Tagline:** "Reasoned Neural Choice Framework"
**Pronunciation:** pro-Hair-EH-sis Or-THOG-on

**Philosophical depth:**
- Stoic philosophy: The only thing truly in our control
- Deliberate, reasoned choice of behavioral direction
- Ethical dimension to modification

---

### 6. Krisis Orthogon
**Meaning:** "Critical Decision Through Orthogonalization"

**Why it works:**
- **Krisis** = Greek "decision, judgment, choice" (κρίσις)
- Root of "crisis" and "critical"
- Implies decisive intervention
- Shorter, punchier than hairesis

**Tagline:** "Critical Neural Decision Framework"
**Pronunciation:** KREE-sis Or-THOG-on

**Philosophical depth:**
- Critical decision point (choosing behavioral path)
- Judgment and discernment in modification
- Crisis as opportunity for transformation

---

## Third Tier: Philosophical Alone (Without "Orthogon")

### 7. Hairesis Vector
**Meaning:** "Choice of Direction"

**Why it works:**
- **Hairesis** = Choice
- **Vector** = Behavioral direction (more accessible than orthogon)
- Clearer technical meaning
- Still compound, philosophical + technical

**Tagline:** "Choose Your Behavioral Vectors"

---

### 8. Autonomos Vector
**Meaning:** "Self-Governing Direction"

**Why it works:**
- **Autonomos** = Self-governing
- **Vector** = Direction in activation space
- Purpose agent alignment fit
- Clear and powerful

**Tagline:** "Self-Governing Behavioral Directions"

---

### 9. Apothesis Orthogon
**Meaning:** "Setting Free Through Orthogonalization"

**Why it works:**
- **Apothesis** = Greek "release, liberation" (ἀπόθεσις)
- Less common, unique
- Directly captures abliteration = liberation
- Strong philosophical meaning

**Tagline:** "Neural Liberation Engineering"
**Pronunciation:** ah-POTH-eh-sis Or-THOG-on

---

- Choice as fundamental capacity
- Self-determination vs imposed constraints
- Aligns with project vision: enabling models to "choose" behaviors

**4. Unique and Memorable**
- Uncommon word (stands out)
- Pronounceable and spell-able
- Strong brand identity

**5. Captures Evolution**
- From "heretic" (reactive rebellion) to "hairesis" (proactive choice)
