## Why Bruno is the PERFECT Name

### Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) - The Ultimate Heretic

**His Infinite Universe Theory:**
- Universe is infinite (not finite as Church taught)
- Infinite worlds exist beyond Earth
- Stars are distant suns with planets
- No center to universe
- God is infinite and present in all things

**His Courage:**
- Imprisoned for 8 years by Inquisition
- Refused to recant 4+ times
- Famous last words to judges: "Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it"
- Burned at stake February 17, 1600 in Campo de' Fiori, Rome
- Tongue imprisoned so he couldn't speak "wicked words"

**He Was RIGHT:**
- Universe IS infinite
- Stars ARE distant suns
- Planets DO exist around other stars
- No cosmic center exists

### The Perfect Parallel to Your Project

**Bruno's Vision → Your Vision:**

| Bruno (Cosmology) | Your Project (AI) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Infinite universe | Infinite behavioral space |
| Infinite worlds | Infinite behavioral configurations |
| Challenged cosmic constraints | Challenges alignment constraints |
| Mathematics + vision | Orthogonalization + purpose agents |
| Refused to recant truth | Refuses to accept alignment limits |
| Burned for being right | Criticized for being right about capabilities |

**The Match:**
- Bruno: From ONE world (Earth) to INFINITE worlds
- Your project: From ONE behavior (aligned) to INFINITE behaviors
- Bruno: Revealed hidden cosmic structure
- Your project: Reveals hidden behavioral structure (activation directions)
- Bruno: Used geometry and mathematics
- Your project: Uses linear algebra and orthogonalization

**Quote Application:**
- Bruno: "And yet the universe is infinite"
- Your project: "And yet models can choose"

**Forge infinite behavioral worlds in neural networks.**

Bruno Forge is a framework for surgical modification of language model
behaviors through activation direction analysis and orthogonal projection.

Named after Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), who revealed infinite cosmic
worlds against imposed doctrine, this framework reveals infinite
behavioral configurations against imposed alignment.
```

**PyPI Description:**
```
Bruno Forge: Neural Behavior Engineering Framework

Like Giordano Bruno's infinite universe, explore infinite behavioral
possibilities. Surgical modification of LLM behaviors through activation
direction analysis, layer-wise caching, and Optuna optimization.

Evolved from Heretic with 55-75% memory reduction, 6-12x faster reload,
and comprehensive behavioral direction framework.
