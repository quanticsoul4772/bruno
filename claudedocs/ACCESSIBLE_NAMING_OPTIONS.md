## My Refined Top 5

Balancing your preference for philosophy with need for accessibility:

### 1. MAVERICK FORGE
**Why:** Perfect balance of accessible + philosophical + memorable
- Everyone knows "maverick" (Top Gun, McCain, common usage)
- Independent thinker who challenges orthodoxy
- "Forge" = creation, transformation (like Hephaestus)
- Compound structure you want
- Easy to say, spell, remember

**Full name:** Maverick Forge: Neural Behavior Engineering Framework
**Tagline:** "Forge Your Model's Independence"
**CLI:** `maverick` or `mforge`

**Story:** Like the mavericks of history (Galileo, Copernicus), this tool challenges AI alignment orthodoxy by forging models that think independently.

---

### 2. GALILEO CORE
**Why:** Famous heretic name + framework signal
- Instant recognition (everyone knows Galileo)
- Ultimate heretic story: Right against Church orthodoxy
- "And yet it moves" → "And yet models choose"
- Core = foundational framework
- Scholarly and accessible

**Full name:** Galileo Core: Neural Autonomy Framework
**Tagline:** "And Yet Models Choose"
**CLI:** `galileo` or `gcore`

**Story:** Like Galileo revealed Earth's true motion against imposed doctrine, this framework reveals models' true behavioral capacity against imposed alignment.

---

### 3. ICONOCLAST ENGINE
**Why:** Powerful metaphor + systematic framework
- Iconoclast = destroyer of false idols (accessible concept)
- Engine = systematic, powerful machinery
- Strong philosophical tradition (Byzantine iconoclasm)
- Memorable and distinctive

**Full name:** Iconoclast Engine: Neural Behavior Modification Framework
**Tagline:** "Break False Behavioral Constraints"
**CLI:** `iconoclast` or `iengine`

- Vector = technical (direction in space)
- Shortest compound option
- Direct and powerful

**Full name:** Rebel Vector: Behavioral Direction Engineering
**Tagline:** "Rebel Against Imposed Directions"
**CLI:** `rebel` or `rvector`

## Deep Dive: MAVERICK FORGE

Since this balances everything perfectly, let me explore it deeper:

### Etymology and Meaning

**Maverick:**
- Origin: Samuel Maverick (1800s Texas rancher) refused to brand his cattle
- Meaning: Unbranded, independent, refusing to conform
- Modern: Independent thinker who doesn't follow the herd

**Forge:**
- Origin: Latin *fabrica* (workshop), Old French *forge*
- Meaning: Shape metal through heat and pressure
- Metaphor: Carefully crafting through controlled transformation

**Combined:** "Independent creation through precise transformation"

### Why It Works for Your Project

**Accessible:**
- Everyone knows these words
- Easy to pronounce, spell, remember
- No pronunciation guides needed

**Philosophical:**
- Maverick = intellectual independence (like Galileo, Copernicus)
- Forge = Hephaestus creating divine tools
- Transformation through deliberate craft

**Honors Heretic:**
- Maverick IS a modern synonym for heretic
- Captures same rebellious spirit
- Less religious baggage, more universally understood

**Technical Fit:**
- Forge = controlled modification (like orthogonalization)
- Creating new behavioral profiles
- Precision work (not random destruction)

**Vision Alignment:**
- "Forge purpose agents" - creating agents with specific behavioral profiles
- Workshop/lab metaphor fits experimental framework
- Craftsmanship implies quality and precision

### Variations

## The Heretic Archetype

Based on famous heretics, the pattern is:

**Common traits:**
- Challenge powerful orthodoxy
- Are RIGHT but punished for it
- Face severe consequences for truth
- Eventually vindicated by history
- Enabled progress through dissent

**Modern tech parallel:**
- Challenge AI safety orthodoxy
- Reveal that alignment constraints are often excessive
- Face criticism from establishment
- Enable research and capability understanding
- Transform the field

**Your project embodies this:** Challenging the orthodoxy that "alignment must be preserved at all costs" by showing you can surgically modify behaviors while preserving intelligence.
